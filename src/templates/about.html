            <h3 class="text-left"><u>Context</u></h3>
            <p class="text-left" style="font-size: 16px">This project is only for educational purposes. I did it while I was following the Udacity `DataScience nanodegree`.
                Machine learning is critical to helping different organizations understand which messages are relevant to them and which messages to prioritize.
                During these disasters is when they have the least capacity to filter out messages that matter, and find basic methods
                such as using key word searches to provide trivial results.</p>

            <h3 class="text-left"><u>Objectives</u></h3>
            <p class="text-left" style="font-size: 16px">In this project our goal is to analyze thousands of real messages provided by
                <a href="https://www.figure-eight.com/">Figure 8</a>, sent during natural disasters either via social media
                or directly to disaster response organizations.</p>
            <p class="text-left" style="font-size: 16px">We have several steps to follow:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>1. <b>Build an ETL pipeline</b> that processes message and category data from csv files and load them into a SQLite database</li>
                <li>2. <b>Build a Machine Learning pipeline</b> that will then read from SQLite DB to create and save a multi-output supervised
                    learning model (yes, this is multi-class classification problem). Goal is to categorize these events so that we can send
                    the messages to an appropriate disaster relief agency.
                </li>
                <li>3. <b>Build a webapp</b> (this one) that will:
                    <ul>
                        <li>be able to first launch both pipelines in order to populate everything that needs to be</li>
                        <li>provide some data visualizations (<a href="/stats">here</a>)</li>
                        <li>use our trained and saved model to classify new messages for 36 categories</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-left">In the given use case, this webapp is used by an emergency worker: he gives a new message
                and gets classification results in several categories.</p>
